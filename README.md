# OpenCity2k-other

 Tools and documentation related to other games that could open .sc2 files.

## Sub-projects

### vrooom

Related to Streets of SimCity. Called "vroom" because EA like sending cease and decist letters for games that they haven't sold in a decade.

- `miff_parse.py`: First pass at parsing the game's .scn files. May be able to save later?
- `race_parse.py`: Wrapper to open .scn and print results. Run it with "-i scenario.scn".
- `scn_spec`: Specification for the file format.

### chopper

Related to SimCopter. Called "chopper" for similar reason as vroom is.
